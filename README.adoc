# BashOut

A simple bash script to turn a terminal emulator into a distraction-free writing environment.

## What it is

I had an idea for a writing app that was super-minimalist and that gave me no option other than to forge ahead with my writing.

I'd tried other, panic-inducing writing tools that promised this, tools like 'Write or Die' and 'Most Dangerous Writing App'.
The ones that delete your work if you pause long enough to scratch your nose!

They worked well enough to get a word count up, but not to create decent prose.
MDWA got me my first NaNoWriMo success.
And then I deleted the utterly unusable manuscript the very next day.

My idea was an enviroment that separated you from your saved file and showed only what you needed to move forward.

With that in mind, and a little help from ChatGPT, I created BashOut.

## What it does

BashOut is a bash script that turns your terminal emulator into a minimalist writing environment by:

* Setting the terminal window to the name of your manuscript.

* Printing an affirmation or reminder, if you set one, at the top of the window.

* Clearing the terminal.

* Printing the last line you wrote.

* Showing session and word counts.

* Presenting a simple colon (`:`) prompt where you write.

And that's it. You get nothing more than you need to move forward with your manuscript.

## How to configure it

. Create a file to which your writing will be saved.

. Open the `bashout.sh` script in your favourite editor/IDE.

. Set an affirmation, should you want one, on one of the following lines:
+
[source.copy,bash]
----
#AFFIRM="Your custom affirmation here"
AFFIRM=$(shuf -n 1 quotes.txt)
----
+
The script defaults to printing a random quote from an included `quotes.txt` file.
You can:

.. Leave it as it is.

.. Comment out both lines to silence the affirmation.

.. Swap the comment from the `custom` line to the `quotes.txt` line, and add your own preferred output.

. Set the path to the file you created in _Step 2_ on this line:
+
[source.copy,bash]
----
SAVE_FILE="test.txt"
----

. The script will use the first line of your manuscript to set the terminal window title.
This assumes that the first line of your manuscript is the title.
If the first line in your file is NOT the title of your manuscript, you can manually set it on this line:
+
[source.copy,bash]
----
MANUSCRIPT_NAME=$(head -n 1 "$SAVE_FILE")
----
+
Or, again, you can comment the following line out if you do not wish to use this feature:
+
[source.copy,bash]
----
printf "\033]0;%s\007" "$MANUSCRIPT_NAME"
----

. If you want to change the colour of the affirmation line, you can pick an ANSI colour to enter on this line:
+
[source.copy,bash]
----
TEXT_COLOUR='\e[34m'
----
+
There's a link included to the Wikipedia list of ANSI colour codes. +
The default is a nice calming blue.

## How to use it

. Download the version for your preferred operating system.
+
* If you're using Cygwin in Windows, you should use the `-win` version.

* If you're using WSL, you should use the `-linux` version.

. Make the downloaded file executable.
Methods will differ based on your environment.

. Run `sh /path/to/bashout.sh` in either a terminal emulator or a TTY session.

. Write until you can't write any more.

. Exit with _Ctrl + C_

. That's it!
