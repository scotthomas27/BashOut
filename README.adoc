= BashOut: A Simple Writing App Script

BashOut is a simple Bash script designed to help you focus on writing by providing a clean interface and tracking your word count.
It also offers inspirational banners, reminders, or style prompts to get your creative juices flowing.

== Usage

.  Fork this repo.

. Clone your fork locally.

.  Make the scripts executable:
+
```bash
chmod +x /path/to/repo/bashout.sh /path/to/repo/styles.sh
```

.  Run the script:
+
```
./bashout.sh
```

The script will present you with a menu to choose a banner style:

Inspirational quote:: Displays a random affirmation from an included quotes list.
Feel free to add more affirmations to `resources/quotes.txt`.

Reminder:: Prompts you to for a reminder, which is then displayed as the banner.
Use this if you need to keep something in mind during a writing session.

Style prompt:: Generates a random writing style prompt from multiple options and displays it.
For example:
+
```bash
Create a uplifting, steadily-paced story with a informal voice in past-tense from a second-person point of view.
```

After selecting a banner, the script:

.  Clears the screen.

.  Displays the chosen banner.

.  Displays the last sentence you wrote (if any).
This is read from a local save file (`work/output.txt`).

.  Prompts you to enter a new sentence, showing your session and total word counts.

.  Appends each new sentence to the local save file.

Press `[Ctrl+C]` to exit the script.
You do not need to do a 'Save', as your input is written to file each time you hit `[Enter]`.

== Functionality

Banner Selection:: The script handles banner selection and display.

Style Prompt Generation:: The script generates random style prompts using predefined lists for:
+
* Voice

* Tone

* Pace

* POV

* Tense

Word Count Tracking:: The main script tracks your session and total word counts.

Saving Progress:: Your writing is automatically saved to `work/output.txt`.

== Configuration and Tweaks

=== `.gitignore` Modifications

By default, the `resources/` and `work/` directories are ignored by Git.
You can modify this behavior:

To track changes to resource files:: Remove `resources/` from `.gitignore`.
This allows you to commit changes to the quotes, reminders, or style prompt files.
The `quotes.txt` file is included in Git control by default in case you make changes to it:
+
```bash
!resources/quotes.txt
```

To track `output.txt`::  Remove `work/` from `.gitignore` to include your writing in your Git repository.
This is generally not recommended unless you are choosing to use Git to back up your work.

=== Changing Banner Color

The banner text color is currently set to a soothing blue (`\e[94m`).
You can change this by modifying the `printf` command in `bashout.sh`.
For example, to change the color to red:

```bash
printf "\e[91m%s\e[0m\n" "$BANNER"
```

Refer to an ANSI escape code chart for other color codes.

=== Other Tweaks

Custom Banner Files:: You could add more banner options by creating new text files in the `resources` directory and adding corresponding cases to the `case` statement in `bashout.sh`.

More affirmations:: You can add more affirmations to the `resources/quotes.txt` file.
You could also modify the script to offer a new affirmation each time you hit `[Enter]`.

Modifying Style Prompts::  Edit the lists in `styles.sh` (`voicelist` or `tonelist`, for example) to customize the generated style prompts.

Saving Location:: Change the `SAVE_FILE` variable in `bashout.sh` to save your writing to a different location.

Starting Word Count:: Session word counts will always start at `0`.
If you want the total word count to also reset, move (or remove) the `work/output.txt` file.
The script will create a new file when it is next run.
